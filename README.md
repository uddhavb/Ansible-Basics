##Setup and Tasks:   
The ansible code for the given assignments in the setup and tasks sections are in the files [setup](setup.yml) and [tasks](tasks.yml) respectively.    

A [screencast](https://youtu.be/yx4HeeMmK5o) showing how to perform the setup and tasks along with the running app is also included in this repository.   

##Concepts:   
**Why should developers use configuration management tools to manage their software programs? What can go wrong?**     

- According to Pressman: Configuration Management is a set of tracking and control activities that are initiated when a software engineering projects begins and terminates when software is taken out of operation
- Configuration Management focuses on establishing and maintaining the consistency of a system throughout its lifetime.   
- It ensures that the current design and build status of the system is known and recorded; and does not rely on the knowledge of the development team. 
- The past builds and designs must be known accurately for tasks like debugging. 
- In general the older versions have great importance in many conditions like where the customers might not have updated their systems. 
- Configuration management ensures that documentation that actually describes the given system is produced.
- It helps with training people to work on the project and also in audits and supporting different product types to different customers.
- Because of CM we can study the wrong design and development patterns that maybe be followed by people and hence avoid them.
- Even when using configuration management certain things can go wrong:
requirements accepted, design implemented, tools used for development, software tested, test suite being used, software version released.
If any of these go wrong it will lead to wastage of time and effort along with delay in deliveries and also dissatisfied customers. 

**Explain the difference between continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment, in your own words.**
